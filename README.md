# Food Visualization
# D3.js

# Approach - Data
Decompose food Information:
Food Type -> Food Item -> Ingredient
# feel free to build data that follow the same structure to reuse the code

# Hierarchical Edge Bundling
Shows relationships among food types, items, and ingredients with incoming and outgoing edges

# Scatter Plots
Show nutrition facts (i.e. calorie, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, protein) on xy coordinate 
X and Y nutritions are interchangeable 

# Pie Chart
Used for highlighting the four quadrants with different colors
Bottom right represents low x and y nutrition facts; top left represent high x and y nutrition facts
